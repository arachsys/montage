Resources for Yamaha Montage
============================

docs/ is the Markdown source for https://arachsys.github.io/montage/ with
links, tools and technical notes for the Montage and related synthesisers.

files/ contains some demonstration Python scripts to list the contents of
Montage X7U/X7L/X7A and MODX X8U/X8L/X8A files.

shell/ has instructions and an image build tree for launching a shell using
the firmware upgrade path in the instrument's linux/arm32 initramfs. This
makes tinkering a lot easier, and simple demonstration scripts are included
to clean up preset part names and fix some buggy preset performances.

See also https://arachsys.github.io/webmidi/ which includes several MIDI
tools specific to the Montage and MODX instruments.

Please report any problems or bugs to Chris Webb <chris@arachsys.com>.
