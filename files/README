Tools for examining Yamaha Montage and MODX files
=================================================

These four example programs catalogue the content of Yamaha Montage and MODX
files, supporting X7U, X7L and X7A files from Montage firmware v3.00/3.50
and X8U, X8L and X8A files from MODX firmware v2.00/2.50/2.51.

  - listarp [FILE]... : list arpeggios
  - listcrv [FILE]... : list motion curves
  - listpfm [FILE]... : list performances
  - listwfm [FILE]... : list waveforms

They should be run with Python 3.6 or later, and have #! magic assuming that
/bin/python is version 3.

It takes very little code to robustly and efficiently parse these files:
most of the fifty lines of each of these scripts is taken with pretty
printing and boilerplate.

The X7U/X7L/X7A and X8U/X8L/X8A format is reverse-engineered and partially
documented on my pages at https://arachsys.github.io/montage/ which also has
notes on the hardware and undocumented system exclusive messages.

Please report any problems or bugs to Chris Webb <chris@arachsys.com>.
