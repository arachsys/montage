Tools for examining Yamaha Montage and MODX files
=================================================

These five example programs catalogue the content of Yamaha Montage and MODX
files, supporting X7U, X7L and X7A files from Montage firmware v3.00 to
v3.51 and X8U, X8L and X8A files from MODX firmware v2.00 to v2.52:

  - listarp [FILE]... : list arpeggios
  - listcrv [FILE]... : list motion curves
  - listpfm [FILE]... : list performances
  - listset [FILE]... : list live sets
  - listwfm [FILE]... : list waveforms

They should be run with Python 3.6 or later, and have #! magic assuming that
/bin/python is version 3.

Similarly, the following utility modifies Montage/MODX files to scale the
overall volume of every performance and live set:

  - fixvolume SCALE-FACTOR [FILE]...

The scale factor can be given in percentage ("85%"), decimal ("1.05") or
fractional ("80/67") form.

To prune unneeded content out of files, use

  - pruneblk TYPE[,TYPE]... [FILE]...

which removes the specified block types. TYPE is not case-sensitive and
should be 'xxx' to remove 'Exxx' and 'Dxxx' blocks, or 'LIB' to clear
installed library info. For example, 'pruneblk sys,sng,lib Test.X7U' removes
system settings, songs and library info from Test.X7U. (Pruning the system
settings prevents them being clobbered on reload of user or backup files.)

It takes very little code to robustly and efficiently parse these files:
most of the fifty lines of each of these scripts is taken with pretty
printing and boilerplate.

The X7U/X7L/X7A and X8U/X8L/X8A format is reverse-engineered and partially
documented on my pages at https://arachsys.github.io/montage/ which also has
notes on the hardware and undocumented system exclusive messages.

Please report any problems or bugs to Chris Webb <chris@arachsys.com>.
